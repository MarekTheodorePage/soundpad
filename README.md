Collective noun


Derivation 
Morphological derivation accounts for many collective words and various languages have common affixes for denoting collective nouns. Because derivation is a slower and less productive word formation process than the more overtly syntactical morphological methods, there are fewer collectives formed this way. As with all derived words, derivational collectives often differ semantically from the original words, acquiring new connotations and even new denotations.


morphological relating to the form or structure of things.

"the purely morphological fact that with a little dam one could hold back a lot of water"

relating to the branch of biology that deals with the form of living organisms, and with relationships between their structures.


At the core soundpad is the morphology the study of the forms of things. This is what I want to explore. Join me on this exciting journey into self realization and the healing energy of the universe. The harmotics of the cosmos.
